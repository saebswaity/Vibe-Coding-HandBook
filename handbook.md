## 1. Understanding AI Agents: The Fundamentals {#understanding-ai-agents}

Before diving into vibe coding, it's crucial to understand how AI agents work, their limitations, and where they excel.

### 1.1 The Anatomy of Large Language Models (LLMs)

#### **How LLMs Process Information**

LLMs are transformer-based neural networks that process text through patterns learned from massive datasets. They don't "understand" in the human sense but excel at pattern matching and generation.

**Processing Flow:**
```
Input ‚Üí Tokenization ‚Üí Embedding ‚Üí Attention Mechanism ‚Üí Generation ‚Üí Output
```

#### **Key Concepts:**

**Tokens**: The basic units of text processing
- 1 token ‚âà 4 characters in English
- 1 token ‚âà 0.75 words
- Code typically uses more tokens due to syntax

**Context Window**: The AI's "working memory"
- **GPT-5**: 128,000 tokens
- **Claude 4 Opus/Sonnet**: 200,000 tokens
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: 1,000,000+ tokens

**Temperature**: Controls randomness (0 = deterministic, 2 = very creative)
- Use 0-0.3 for code generation
- Use 0.7-1.0 for creative problem-solving

#### **The Context Window Paradox: Is Bigger Always Better?**

**The Paradox**: While larger context windows seem better (more information = better responses), they create unexpected challenges:

| Context Window Size | Advantages | Hidden Problems |
|-------------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Small (4K-8K tokens)** | ‚úÖ Focused attention<br/>‚úÖ Consistent quality<br/>‚úÖ Lower cost | ‚ùå Limited information<br/>‚ùå Frequent truncation |
| **Medium (32K-128K tokens)** | ‚úÖ Good balance<br/>‚úÖ Handles most projects<br/>‚úÖ Reasonable cost | ‚ùå Some information loss<br/>‚ùå Occasional drift |
| **Large (200K-1M+ tokens)** | ‚úÖ Massive information<br/>‚úÖ No truncation | ‚ùå **Attention dilution**<br/>‚ùå **Lost in the middle**<br/>‚ùå Higher cost |

#### **The "Lost in the Middle" Problem**

**Research Finding**: LLMs with large context windows often **ignore information in the middle** of the context, focusing mainly on the beginning and end. This means:

- **Position 1-1000**: High attention ‚úÖ
- **Position 5000-50000**: **Lost attention** ‚ùå 
- **Position 195000-200000**: High attention ‚úÖ

#### **Why This Matters for Vibe Coding**

This paradox is exactly why we need **strategic context management**:

1. **üéØ Warm-up Sessions**: Load the most important information at the **beginning** of conversations
2. **üìã Planning**: Create focused, digestible chunks instead of dumping everything
3. **üîÑ Progressive Loading**: Add context strategically as you work
4. **‚ö° Fresh Sessions**: Reset when context gets too long or unfocused

**Key Insight**: Our entire methodology (warm-ups, context files, planning) is designed to **outsmart the context window paradox** by strategically managing what goes where in the AI's attention.

#### **Practical Implications:**

| Aspect | What It Means for Coding |
|--------|--------------------------|
| **Token Limit** | Long files may be truncated; split complex tasks |
| **Context Decay** | Earlier conversation parts lose influence |
| **No State Memory** | Each session starts fresh; can't remember previous chats |
| **Attention Dilution** | Too much context can make AI miss important details |
| **Position Bias** | Information at start/end gets more attention than middle |
| **Pattern Matching** | Excels at common patterns, struggles with novel problems |
| **Hallucination Risk** | May confidently generate incorrect code |

### 1.2 AI Coding Agents vs Base LLMs

**Important Distinction**: There's a huge difference between a base LLM (like ChatGPT) and an AI coding agent (like Cursor, Claude with tools, GitHub Copilot, etc.).

#### **AI Coding Agents = LLM + Tools + Project Access**

Modern AI coding agents are **LLMs enhanced with tools** that can:

#### **‚úÖ What AI Coding Agents CAN Do:**
- **üìÅ Read your project files** - Access any file in your codebase
- **‚úèÔ∏è Edit code directly** - Modify files, create new ones, refactor existing code
- **üîç Search codebases** - Find functions, classes, usage patterns across files
- **üóÉÔ∏è Database access** - Query databases, examine schemas (with proper tools)
- **‚ö° Run commands** - Execute tests, builds, scripts, linters
- **üåê Web search** - Get real-time information about libraries, errors
- **üì¶ Package management** - Install dependencies, check versions
- **üîß System operations** - File operations, environment setup
- **üìä Code analysis** - Static analysis, complexity metrics, security scanning

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è What They Still Can't Do Well:**
- **üß† Complex reasoning** - Multi-step logical deduction, mathematical proofs
- **üéØ Business context** - Understanding your company's specific domain rules
- **üöÄ Performance optimization** - Complex algorithmic improvements without data
- **üé® UX/Design decisions** - Aesthetic and user experience choices
- **üîí Security architecture** - High-level security design decisions
- **üìà Scalability planning** - Infrastructure and architectural decisions for scale

#### **The Tool Ecosystem:**

| Tool Category | Examples | What It Enables |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| **File Operations** | read_file, write_file, search | Direct codebase manipulation |
| **Command Execution** | terminal, shell commands | Testing, building, deploying |
| **Code Analysis** | AST parsers, linters, formatters | Code quality and structure analysis |
| **Database Tools** | SQL clients, ORM tools | Data inspection and modification |
| **Web Access** | search, API calls | Real-time information and updates |
| **Version Control** | git commands, diff tools | Code history and collaboration |

#### **Key Insight for Vibe Coding:**
The power of vibe coding comes from **AI agents with tools**, not just raw LLMs. When you're working with Cursor, Claude with tools, or similar platforms, you're leveraging an AI that can actually interact with your development environment.

### 1.3 Selecting the Right LLM for Vibe Coding

Choosing the right LLM is a critical decision that balances **performance**, **cost**, and **context window size**. The most powerful model isn't always the best choice for every task.

#### **Performance: AI Coding Benchmarks**

To objectively measure an LLM's coding ability, we rely on standardized benchmarks. These tests evaluate models on real-world software engineering tasks.

| Benchmark | Focus | What It Tells You |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SWE-bench** | Real-world bug fixes and feature implementations from GitHub issues. | How well the model performs complex, multi-file tasks that require understanding an existing codebase. **This is a top-tier indicator for vibe coding.** |
| **HumanEval** | Generating correct, standalone Python functions from docstrings. | Core problem-solving and algorithmic reasoning ability. Good for gauging raw coding logic. |
| **LiveCodeBench** | Contest-style programming problems that require incremental coding and debugging. | How well the model can "think on its feet" and correct its own mistakes, a key part of an interactive workflow. |

**Strategy**: Look for models that perform well on **SWE-bench** for general development and **HumanEval** for algorithmic tasks.

#### **The Price-Performance Spectrum**

Models exist on a spectrum from cheap and fast to expensive and powerful. Your goal is to pick the most cost-effective model that can successfully complete the task.

| Tier | Example Models | Best For... | Relative Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **üëë Flagship** |  Claude 4 Opus | Complex logic, architectural planning, critical bug fixes, refactoring legacy code. | `$$$$` |
| **üéØ Balanced** | Claude 4 Sonnet, gpt5, Gemini 2.5 Pro | **The vibe coding sweet spot.** Feature implementation, test generation, documentation, everyday debugging. | `$$` |
| **‚ö° Economy** | gpt 5 mini| Simple boilerplate, code translation, quick scripts, formatting, generating simple config files. | `$` |

#### **Understanding Token Costs**

You pay for what you use, and costs are calculated per token. Pricing is typically listed per **1 million tokens** and is different for input (context you provide) and output (code the AI generates).



**Key Takeaway**: Your context files (`.ai/context/`) are a recurring **input cost**. A smaller, more efficient context saves you money with every prompt. An LLM that generates concise, correct code is cheaper on the **output** side.

#### **Practical Selection Strategy**

1. **Default to a Balanced Model**: Start with a model like gpt5/gpt5 mini Sonnet for most tasks.
2. **Escalate When Stuck**: If the balanced model fails to solve the problem or produces low-quality code after 2-3 attempts, switch to a Flagship model like claude 4 or opus for that specific task.
3. **Delegate Down When Simple**: For simple, repetitive tasks like generating boilerplate or config files, use an Economy model like Haiku to save costs.

### 1.4 The Data Advantage: Why LLMs Excel at Popular Technologies

## 4. AI Context Management & Warm-Up Sessions {#ai-context-management}

**The Core Connection**: Context window size, context files, and warm-up sessions are intimately related. Your context window is AI's "working memory" - and everything you put in it (context files, warm-up prompts, conversation history) competes for that precious space. Understanding this relationship is crucial for effective vibe coding.

**Key Insights:**
- **Context files** provide the static foundation (project info, architecture, standards)
- **Warm-up prompts** activate that context and establish the working relationship 
- **Context window size** determines how much information the AI can actively use
- **Progressive loading** helps you manage this limited space efficiently

### 4.1 Context Strategy Framework

#### **The Three-Layer Context Model**

| Layer | Type | Lifetime | Purpose | Examples |
|-------|------|----------|---------|----------|
| **üèóÔ∏è Layer 1** | **Project Context** | Persistent, rarely changes | Core project info, architecture, standards | Tech stack, database schema, coding conventions |
| **üéØ Layer 2** | **Feature Context** | Feature-specific, medium lifetime | Current feature details, related files | User auth implementation, API endpoints |
| **‚ö° Layer 3** | **Task Context** | Immediate task, short lifetime | Specific task instructions | "Fix login bug", "Add validation to email field" |

**Context Flow:**
```
Project Context (always included) 
    ‚Üì 
+ Feature Context (when working on specific feature)
    ‚Üì
+ Task Context (immediate instructions)
    ‚Üì
= Complete AI Understanding
```

### 4.2 Context File Templates

#### **Project Context** (`.ai/context/project.md`):
```markdown
# Project Context

## System Architecture
- Microservices: Auth, API, Worker
- Communication: REST + Redis Queue
- Deployment: Docker + Kubernetes

## Database Schema Summary
- Users table: id, email, password_hash, created_at
- Sessions table: id, user_id, token, expires_at
- [Include key relationships]

## API Endpoints Structure
- /api/v1/auth/* - Authentication
- /api/v1/users/* - User management
- /api/v1/resources/* - Main resources

## Critical Business Rules
1. All API calls require authentication except /auth/login
2. Passwords must be bcrypt hashed
3. Sessions expire after 24 hours
```

#### **Feature Context** (`.ai/context/features/feature_name.md`):
```markdown
# Feature: [Feature Name]

## Related Files
- Models: src/models/user.py
- Views: src/views/auth.py
- Tests: tests/test_auth.py

## Dependencies
- Libraries: pyjwt==2.8.0
- Internal: src/utils/crypto.py

## Current State
- [X] Basic structure created
- [ ] Token generation implemented
- [ ] Refresh logic added

## Known Issues
- None currently
```

#### **Task Context** (Inline in prompt):
```markdown
CURRENT TASK: Implement JWT refresh token endpoint
FILES TO MODIFY: src/views/auth.py, src/serializers/auth.py
CONSTRAINTS: Must maintain backward compatibility
```

### 4.3 Context Management Best Practices

#### **When to Reset Context**
- After completing a major feature
- When switching between frontend/backend
- After 10+ conversation turns
- When AI responses become inconsistent

#### **Context Optimization Techniques**

1. **Use Reference Pointers Instead of Full Content**
   ```markdown
   BAD: [Paste entire 500-line file]
   GOOD: "See src/models/user.py for User model structure"
   ```

2. **Summarize Previous Work**
   ```markdown
   "We've completed:
   1. User authentication (working)
   2. Token generation (working)
   Next: Add refresh token logic"
   ```

3. **Progressive Context Loading**
   ```markdown
   Start: "Working on auth system"
   Add when needed: "Using JWT tokens"
   Add when needed: "Token expiry is 15 minutes"
   ```

### 4.4 Warm-Up Sessions

#### **Why Warm-Up Sessions Matter**

Starting with a proper warm-up ensures:
- AI understands project context
- Consistent code style
- Reduced errors and hallucinations
- Faster development iteration

**The Connection**: Warm-up sessions are essentially **context loading in action**. They bridge the gap between your static context files and the dynamic conversation with AI.

#### **Warm-Up Prompt Templates**

##### **New Feature Development**

```

##### **Refactoring Session**
```markdown
You are a refactoring expert. We're improving existing code.

CODEBASE CONTEXT:
- Age: [AGE]
- Main issues: [LIST_PROBLEMS]
- Goals: [IMPROVEMENT_GOALS]

REFACTORING PRINCIPLES:
1. Maintain backward compatibility
2. Improve test coverage
3. Reduce complexity
4. Follow SOLID principles

I'll share code that needs refactoring. Ready to analyze?
```

#### **Progressive Context Loading**

Start minimal, add detail as needed:

```markdown
# Initial Warm-Up
"You are my Python/Django expert. We're working on an e-commerce API."

# After Acknowledgment, Add Layer 2
"Specifically, we're building the order processing system. 
Key models: Order, OrderItem, Payment."

# When Starting Specific Task, Add Layer 3
"Now let's implement the order status transition logic.
Rules: pending -> processing -> shipped -> delivered.
Only admins can move backwards in status."
```

**Key Insight**: This mirrors the Three-Layer Context Model - you're progressively loading context in the conversation just like you organize it in files.

### 4.5 Planning: The Bridge Between Sessions

#### **Why Planning Matters for AI Sessions**

Plans are **reusable context assets** that enable session continuity. Here's the typical flow:

**üìã Session 1: Planning**
```
Warm-up Prompt + Project Context + Feature Requirements 
    ‚Üì
AI helps create detailed plan
    ‚Üì
Save plan to /plans/active/feature-x.md
```

**üî® Session 2+: Implementation**
```
Warm-up Prompt + Project Context + Feature Plan
    ‚Üì
AI implements specific parts of the plan
    ‚Üì
Update plan with progress
```

#### **The Planning Session Pattern**

##### **Initial Planning Session**
```markdown
You are my expert software architect and pair programmer.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
[Include project.md content]

TASK:
Help me create a detailed implementation plan for: [FEATURE_NAME]

HIGH-LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:
1. [Requirement 1]
2. [Requirement 2] 
3. [Requirement 3]

Please create a structured plan including:
- Technical requirements breakdown
- Database changes needed
- API endpoints to create
- Testing strategy
- Implementation steps (in order)
- Acceptance criteria

Format this as a markdown document I can save and reference.
```

##### **Implementation Session (Later)**
```markdown
You are my expert pair programmer. Let's continue working on a feature.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
[Include project.md content]

FEATURE PLAN:
[Include the saved plan from /plans/active/feature-x.md]

TODAY'S TASK:
Implement step 3 from our plan: "Create user authentication middleware"

Let's start with the implementation, referring to our existing plan.
```

#### **Plan as Living Document**

Plans evolve during implementation:

| Session Type | Plan Usage | Updates |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| **Planning Session** | Create initial plan | Generate complete structure |
| **Implementation Session** | Reference specific steps | Mark completed steps, add discoveries |
| **Debugging Session** | Context for what should work | Add known issues, solutions |
| **Review Session** | Verify completeness | Add refinements, next steps |

#### **Example Plan Structure**

```markdown
# Feature: User Authentication System
# Status: In Progress (Step 3/8)
# Last Updated: [DATE]

## Overview
JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens

## Implementation Progress
- [x] Step 1: Create User model
- [x] Step 2: Set up password hashing
- [ ] Step 3: Create authentication middleware ‚Üê CURRENT
- [ ] Step 4: Build login endpoint
- [ ] Step 5: Implement refresh token logic
- [ ] Step 6: Add logout functionality
- [ ] Step 7: Write comprehensive tests
- [ ] Step 8: Add rate limiting

## Current Session Notes
Working on middleware - need to handle JWT parsing and validation
```

#### **Key Benefits of This Approach**

1. **üîÑ Session Continuity**: Plans bridge the gap between separate AI sessions
2. **üìç Progress Tracking**: Always know where you left off
3. **üß† Context Efficiency**: Smaller, focused context per session
4. **üéØ Reduced Re-explanation**: AI understands the bigger picture from the plan
5. **üîÄ Flexible Implementation**: Can work on any step, in any order

**The Magic**: Instead of re-explaining the entire feature each session, you just point to the plan. The AI instantly understands the context, progress, and next steps.

## 6. Understanding Git: Version Control for Everyone {#understanding-git}

### What is Git?

**Git** is like a sophisticated "save system" for your code projects. Imagine if every time you made changes to a document, you could save a complete snapshot of the entire project, with the ability to go back to any previous version, see exactly what changed, and even work on multiple versions simultaneously. That's essentially what Git does for software projects.

Think of Git as a **time machine for your code** that also enables **collaboration superpowers**.

### Why is Git Essential for Software Development?

#### **üï∞Ô∏è Time Travel for Your Code**

Every time you make significant changes to your project, Git can create a "checkpoint" (called a **commit**). This means:
- **Never lose work**: Even if you accidentally delete something, it's saved in Git
- **Experiment fearlessly**: Try new features knowing you can always go back
- **See project evolution**: Watch how your project grew over time
- **Compare versions**: See exactly what changed between any two points in time

**Real-world example**: You're building a website and decide to change the color scheme. After an hour, you realize the old colors were better. With Git, you can instantly revert to the previous version instead of manually undoing dozens of changes.

#### **üë• Collaboration Made Simple**

Git enables multiple people to work on the same project without stepping on each other's toes:
- **Parallel development**: Team members can work on different features simultaneously
- **Merge changes safely**: Git intelligently combines everyone's work
- **Track contributions**: See exactly who changed what and when
- **Resolve conflicts**: When two people change the same thing, Git helps resolve it

#### **üèóÔ∏è Professional Development Workflow**

Git is the foundation of how professional software teams work:
- **Branching**: Create separate "tracks" for different features
- **Pull requests**: Propose changes and get them reviewed before merging
- **Release management**: Tag and manage different versions of your software
- **Backup and distribution**: Your code is automatically backed up and shareable

### Git Concepts Explained Simply

#### **Repository (Repo)**
A **repository** is your project folder that Git is tracking. Think of it as a special folder that remembers everything that ever happened inside it.

```
my-website/               ‚Üê This is your repository
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .git/                ‚Üê Hidden folder where Git stores all the history
```

#### **Commits**
A **commit** is like taking a photograph of your entire project at a specific moment. Each commit has:
- **A snapshot** of all your files at that moment
- **A message** describing what you changed
- **A timestamp** of when you made it
- **An author** (you!)

Example commit messages:
- "Add user login functionality"
- "Fix bug in shopping cart calculation"
- "Update homepage design"

#### **Branches**
**Branches** let you work on different versions of your project simultaneously. Imagine you're writing a book:
- **Main branch**: Your final, published version
- **Chapter-revision branch**: You're rewriting chapter 3
- **New-ending branch**: You're experimenting with a different ending
- **Translation branch**: Someone is translating to Spanish

You can switch between branches instantly and eventually merge the good changes back to the main branch.

#### **Remote Repository**
A **remote repository** is a copy of your project stored on the internet (like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket). This enables:
- **Backup**: Your code is safe even if your computer crashes
- **Sharing**: Others can access and contribute to your project
- **Synchronization**: Keep multiple computers in sync
- **Collaboration**: Team members can push and pull changes

### How Git Fits into Vibe Coding

Git is **essential** for vibe coding because:

#### **ü§ñ AI Needs Context**
When working with AI assistants, having a well-organized Git history helps:
- AI can see what you've built so far
- AI understands the project structure and evolution
- AI can suggest changes that fit your coding patterns
- AI can help you revert or modify previous decisions

#### **üîÑ Safe Experimentation**
Vibe coding encourages rapid experimentation with AI assistance:
- Try AI-generated solutions without fear
- Keep multiple approaches in different branches
- Easily compare AI-generated vs. human-written code
- Roll back if an AI suggestion doesn't work out

#### **üìã Track AI Contributions**
With Git, you can:
- See which parts were AI-generated vs. human-written
- Track how AI suggestions evolved your project
- Share your AI-assisted development process with others
- Learn from successful AI collaboration patterns

### Basic Git Workflow for Beginners

Here's a simple workflow that works perfectly with vibe coding:

mkdir my-awesome-app
cd my-awesome-app

# Initialize Git
git init

# Connect to a remote repository (like GitHub)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my-awesome-app.git
```

#### **2. Daily Development Cycle**
```bash
# Check current status
git status

# Add your changes
git add .

# Create a commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Add user authentication with AI assistance"

# Push to remote repository
git push origin main
```

#### **3. Feature Development with Branches**
```bash
# Create a new branch for a feature
git checkout -b feature/user-profiles

# Work on your feature with AI assistance
# ... make changes ...

# Commit your progress
git add .
git commit -m "Implement user profile display"

# Switch back to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge your feature
git merge feature/user-profiles
```

### Git Tools That Work Great with AI

#### **Scenario 1: AI Generated Bad Code**
```bash
# Oh no! The AI suggestion broke something
git status                    # See what changed
git checkout -- filename.js  # Revert that specific file
# Or revert the entire commit:
git revert HEAD              # Undo the last commit safely
```

#### **Scenario 2: Experimenting with AI Suggestions**
```bash
# Create experimental branch
git checkout -b experiment/ai-optimization

# Try the AI's suggestion
# ... implement changes ...

# If it works:
git checkout main
git merge experiment/ai-optimization

# If it doesn't work:
git checkout main
git branch -d experiment/ai-optimization  # Delete the experiment
```

#### **Scenario 3: Collaborative AI Development**
```bash
# Get the latest changes from your team
git pull origin main

# Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# Work with AI assistance
# ... develop feature ...

# Push your branch for review
git push origin feature/my-feature
# Create a pull request on GitHub for team review
```

### Git Best Practices for Vibe Coding

#### **‚úÖ Do's**
- **Commit frequently**: Save your progress after each small improvement
- **Write clear messages**: Describe what you changed and why
- **Use branches**: Keep experimental work separate from stable code
- **Pull before pushing**: Stay in sync with team changes
- **Back up regularly**: Push to remote repositories often

#### **‚ùå Don'ts**
- **Don't commit broken code**: Make sure your code works before committing
- **Don't commit secrets**: Never include passwords or API keys
- **Don't work directly on main**: Use feature branches for development
- **Don't ignore conflicts**: Address merge conflicts promptly
- **Don't commit generated files**: Usually don't need to track compiled code

### Why Git Makes You a Better Developer

Even as a beginner using AI assistance, Git teaches you:
- **Project organization**: How to structure and manage code
- **Change management**: How to track and control modifications
- **Collaboration skills**: How to work with others on code
- **Professional habits**: Industry-standard development practices
- **Problem-solving**: How to handle conflicts and issues

Git might seem complex at first, but it's like learning to drive - once you understand the basics, it becomes second nature and enables incredible freedom and capability.

With vibe coding and Git together, you have both an intelligent AI partner and a professional foundation for building amazing software projects! üöÄ

## 7. Advanced Planning Techniques {#plan-generation}

*For basic planning concepts and session patterns, see [Section 4.5: Planning](#ai-context-management).*

This section covers advanced planning techniques for complex features and large projects.

### 6.1 Multi-Feature Planning

For large features that span multiple sessions, create **hierarchical plans**:

```markdown
# Epic: User Management System

## Sub-Features
1. [Authentication](plans/active/auth.md) - Status: Complete
2. [User Profiles](plans/active/profiles.md) - Status: In Progress  
3. [Role Management](plans/active/roles.md) - Status: Planned

## Dependencies
- Profiles depends on Authentication
- Role Management depends on both Auth and Profiles

## Integration Points
- Shared middleware for auth checks
- Common user validation utilities
- Unified error handling
```

### 6.2 Plan Templates for Common Features

#### **Authentication Feature Template**
```markdown
# Feature: Authentication System

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] User model design
- [ ] Password security (hashing + salt)
- [ ] Session/token management
- [ ] Login/logout endpoints  
- [ ] Password reset flow
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] Security testing
- [ ] Integration tests

## Security Considerations
- Password complexity requirements
- Session timeout policies
- Failed login attempt handling
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection in forms
```

#### **API Feature Template**
```markdown
# Feature: [Resource] API

## REST Endpoints
- [ ] GET /api/[resource] - List with pagination
- [ ] GET /api/[resource]/:id - Get single item
- [ ] POST /api/[resource] - Create new
- [ ] PUT /api/[resource]/:id - Update existing
- [ ] DELETE /api/[resource]/:id - Remove item

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Database model/schema
- [ ] Validation schemas
- [ ] Route handlers
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Authentication middleware
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests
```

### 6.3 Plan Versioning Strategy

Track plan evolution as requirements change:

```markdown
# Feature: User Dashboard
# Version: 2.1
# Last Updated: 2024-01-15

## Version History
- v1.0: Basic dashboard with user stats
- v2.0: Added analytics widgets
- v2.1: Added real-time notifications ‚Üê CURRENT

## Current Changes from v2.0
- Added WebSocket connection for live updates
- New notification component
- Modified database schema for notifications
```

---

## 7. The Core Workflow {#core-workflow}

### 7.1 The Complete Development Loop

**Linear Flow:**
```
Create Branch ‚Üí Warm-Up AI ‚Üí Load Context ‚Üí Generate Code ‚Üí 
Human Review ‚Üí Write Tests ‚Üí Run Tests

```
**Decision Points & Loops:**
```
Tests Pass?
‚îú‚îÄ No ‚Üí Debug with AI ‚Üí (back to Generate Code)
‚îî‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Feature Complete?
                  ‚îú‚îÄ No ‚Üí Next Subtask ‚Üí (back to Generate Code)
                  ‚îî‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Create PR

```
**Step-by-Step Workflow:**

| Step | Action | Owner | Description |
|------|--------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | **Create Branch** | Human | Create feature/fix/refactor branch |
| 2 | **Warm-Up AI** | Human | Start fresh chat, load context |
| 3 | **Load Context** | Human | Provide project info, feature plan |
| 4 | **Generate Code** | AI | Write implementation based on requirements |
| 5 | **Human Review** | Human | Review, adjust, improve generated code |
| 6 | **Write Tests** | AI/Human | Create comprehensive test coverage |
| 7 | **Run Tests** | Human | Execute tests and check results |
| 8a | **Debug (if fail)** | AI/Human | Fix issues, return to step 4 |
| 8b | **Commit (if pass)** | Human | Save progress with descriptive message |
| 9 | **Check Completion** | Human | Assess if feature is done |
| 10a | **Next Subtask** | Human | Continue with next part (return to step 4) |
| 10b | **Create PR** | Human | Submit for review and merge |

### 7.2 Detailed Workflow Steps

#### **Step 1: Branch Creation**
```bash
# Feature branch
git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]

# Bugfix branch
git checkout -b fix/[bug-description]

# Refactor branch
git checkout -b refactor/[component-name]
```

#### **Step 2: AI Session Initialization**
1. Start fresh chat session
2. Load warm-up prompt
3. Provide project context
4. Load feature plan

#### **Step 3: Iterative Development**

**The Five-Command Pattern:**
```bash
# 1. Generate
"Generate the [COMPONENT] based on our plan"

# 2. Review
[Human reviews, adjusts code]

# 3. Test
"Write unit tests for this component"

# 4. Run
pytest tests/test_[component].py

# 5. Commit
git add . && git commit -m "feat: implement [component]"
```

#### **Step 4: Incremental Commits**

**Commit Message Format:**
```
type(scope): description

- feat: new feature
- fix: bug fix
- refactor: code restructuring
- test: adding tests
- docs: documentation
- style: formatting
```

**Example Commit Flow:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): add user model"
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement password hashing"
git commit -m "test(auth): add user model tests"
git commit -m "feat(auth): create login endpoint"
git commit -m "fix(auth): handle empty password case"
```

## 8. Refactoring Strategy {#refactoring-strategy}

### What is Refactoring?

**Refactoring** is the process of improving existing code without changing what it does. Think of it like renovating a house - you're making it better, more organized, and easier to maintain, but it's still the same house with the same functionality.

#### Why is Refactoring Important?

Imagine you wrote a recipe for making pizza, but over time you kept adding more ingredients and steps. Eventually, the recipe becomes confusing, with ingredients listed in random order and unclear instructions. Refactoring is like rewriting that recipe to be clear, organized, and easy to follow - the pizza tastes exactly the same, but the recipe is much better.

In software development, refactoring helps:

**üßπ Clean Up Messy Code**
- Remove duplicate code (like having the same recipe steps written multiple times)
- Organize code into logical sections
- Fix confusing variable names (changing `x` to `userAge` for clarity)

**üìö Make Code Easier to Understand**
- Add clear comments explaining what the code does
- Break large, complex functions into smaller, focused ones
- Use consistent naming patterns throughout the project

**üöÄ Improve Performance**
- Optimize slow parts of the code
- Remove unnecessary operations
- Make the software run faster and use less memory

**üîß Make Future Changes Easier**
- Well-organized code is easier to modify and extend
- Reduces the chance of introducing bugs when adding new features
- Makes it easier for other people (including AI assistants) to understand and work with your code

#### Real-World Refactoring Examples

**Example 1: Simplifying Complex Code**
```
Before Refactoring (confusing):
A function that calculates user discounts, sends emails, updates the database, 
and generates reports all in one giant 200-line function.

After Refactoring (clear):
- calculateDiscount() - handles discount logic
- sendNotificationEmail() - sends emails
- updateUserDatabase() - updates data
- generateReport() - creates reports
```

**Example 2: Removing Duplicate Code**
```
Before: The same login validation code copied in 5 different places
After: One central validateLogin() function used everywhere
```

**Example 3: Better Naming**
```
Before: Variables named x, data, temp, stuff
After: Variables named userName, customerOrders, temporaryPassword, userPreferences
```

#### When Should You Refactor?

- **After adding several new features** - Clean up the accumulated "mess"
- **When code becomes hard to understand** - If you or others struggle to read it
- **Before adding major new features** - Start with a clean foundation
- **When you find repeated code** - Consolidate duplicates into reusable pieces
- **When fixing bugs** - Often reveals areas that need cleaning up

#### Refactoring is Safe with AI

One of the best things about refactoring with AI assistance is that it's much safer than doing it manually:

- **AI maintains functionality** - It won't accidentally change what your code does
- **AI suggests improvements** - It can spot issues you might miss
- **AI updates tests** - It ensures your tests still work after refactoring
- **AI follows best practices** - It applies industry-standard improvements

Think of AI as having a renovation expert who guarantees your house will work exactly the same way, but be much more beautiful and efficient when they're done.

### 8.1 When to Refactor

#### **The 3-5-10 Rule**

- **After 3 features**: Quick cleanup
  - Fix naming inconsistencies
  - Extract common utilities
  - Update documentation

- **After 5 features**: Structural review
  - Consolidate duplicate code
  - Improve error handling
  - Optimize database queries

- **After 10 features**: Major refactoring
  - Architectural improvements
  - Performance optimization
  - Comprehensive testing review

### 8.2 AI-Assisted Refactoring Process

#### **Step 1: Code Analysis**
```markdown
Analyze this codebase section for:
1. Code duplication
2. Complex functions (cyclomatic complexity > 10)
3. Poor naming
4. Missing error handling
5. Performance bottlenecks

[Paste code or file paths]
```

#### **Step 2: Refactoring Plan**
```markdown
Based on your analysis, create a refactoring plan:
1. Priority issues to address
2. Suggested improvements
3. Risk assessment
4. Testing requirements
```

#### **Step 3: Incremental Refactoring**
```markdown
Let's refactor the [COMPONENT] to:
- Reduce complexity
- Improve readability
- Add proper error handling

Maintain exact functionality. Show before/after.
```

### 8.3 Refactoring Checklist

#### **Before Refactoring:**
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code committed
- [ ] Metrics recorded (complexity, coverage)
- [ ] Performance baseline established

#### **During Refactoring:**
- [ ] One change at a time
- [ ] Tests still passing after each change
- [ ] No functionality changes
- [ ] Comments updated

#### **After Refactoring:**
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Metrics improved
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated

### 8.4 Common Refactoring Patterns

#### **Extract Method**
```python
# Before
def process_order(order):
    # 50 lines of validation logic
    # 30 lines of calculation logic
    # 20 lines of notification logic

# After
def process_order(order):
    validate_order(order)
    calculate_totals(order)
    send_notifications(order)
```

#### **Replace Magic Numbers**
```python
# Before
if user.age >= 18:
    allow_access()

# After
MINIMUM_AGE = 18
if user.age >= MINIMUM_AGE:
    allow_access()
```

#### **Consolidate Duplicate Code**
```python
# Before
def process_credit_payment(amount):
    # 20 lines of processing
    log_transaction("credit", amount)

def process_debit_payment(amount):
    # Same 20 lines of processing
    log_transaction("debit", amount)

# After
def process_payment(amount, payment_type):
    # 20 lines of processing
    log_transaction(payment_type, amount)
```

## 9. Testing Philosophy {#testing-philosophy}

### 9.1 The Testing Pyramid

**Testing Distribution:**

| Test Type | Coverage % | Focus | Examples |
|-----------|------------|-------|----------|
| **üî∫ E2E** | 5% | Critical user journeys | Complete user flows, payment processing |
| **üî∑ Integration** | 20% | API & component integration | Database connections, service communication |
| **üî≥ Unit** | 75% | Individual functions/methods | Business logic, utilities, validators |

**Why This Distribution Works:**
- **Unit tests**: Fast, reliable, easy to debug, cover edge cases
- **Integration tests**: Verify components work together, catch interface issues  
- **E2E tests**: Ensure critical paths work end-to-end, highest confidence

**Key Principles:**
- More tests at the bottom = faster feedback
- Fewer tests at the top = slower but more comprehensive
- Each level tests different concerns

### 9.2 AI-Generated Test Strategies

#### **Unit Test Generation**
```markdown
Generate comprehensive unit tests for:

```python
[Paste function/class]
```

Include:
1. Happy path
2. Edge cases (empty, null, boundary values)
3. Error conditions
4. Mock external dependencies
```

#### **Integration Test Generation**
```markdown
Create integration tests for the [ENDPOINT] API:

Endpoint: [METHOD] /api/[path]
Request body: [Schema]

## 10. Best Practices & Guidelines {#best-practices}

### 10.1 The Golden Rules

1. **Human First**: You are the architect; AI is the assistant
2. **Trust but Verify**: Always review AI-generated code
3. **Context is King**: Better context = better output
4. **Incremental Progress**: Small, tested changes
5. **Fresh Starts**: Reset sessions regularly

### 10.2 Security Considerations

#### **Never Share with AI:**
- Production passwords
- API keys
- Customer data
- Proprietary algorithms
- Security vulnerabilities

#### **Always Review for:**
- SQL injection risks
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Authentication bypasses
- Data exposure
- Rate limiting

### 10.3 Performance Optimization

#### **AI Code Review Prompt:**
```markdown
Review this code for performance:

```python
[Paste code]


Identify:
1. N+1 query problems
2. Unnecessary loops
